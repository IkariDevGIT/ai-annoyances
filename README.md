Capitalization doesn't matter!
* means anythign can be between it.

The format should be like this:
```json
{
  "shiver down * spine": {
    "importance": "high",
    "type": "annoyance",
    "alternatives": [
      "quiver through *'s body"
    ]
  },
...
}
```

alternatives is optional!

importance: high, medium, low
types: annoyance(things like "shiver down * spine", or "just above a whisper"), refusal(pretty obvious what this means, something like "im sorry, but", or "as an AI" and so on)

if [word1/word2/word3/...] is placed somewhere in the entry, it means it can be one of those words
